              draft-ietf-ace-authcred-dtls-profile-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   Profile for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained
   Environments (ACE).  In particular, it specifies the use of
   additional formats of authentication credentials for establishing a
   DTLS session, when peer authentication is based on asymmetric
   cryptography.  Therefore, this document updates RFC 9202.  What is
   defined in this document is seamlessly applicable also if the profile
   uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead, as defined in RFC 9430.

1.  Introduction

   The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) framework [RFC9200] defines an architecture to enforce access
   control for constrained devices.  A client (C) requests an evidence
   of granted permissions from an authorization server (AS) in the form
   of an access token, then uploads the access token to the target
   resource server (RS), and finally accesses protected resources at RS
   according to what is specified in the access token.

   The framework has as main building blocks the OAuth 2.0 framework
   [RFC6749], the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] for
   message transfer, CBOR [RFC8949] for compact encoding, and COSE
   [RFC9052][RFC9053] for self-contained protection of access tokens.

   Separate profile documents define in detail how the participants in
   the ACE architecture communicate, especially as to the security
   protocols that they use.  In particular, the ACE profile defined in
   [RFC9202] specifies how Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC6347][RFC9147] is used to protect communications with transport-
   layer security in the ACE architecture.  The profile has also been
   extended in [RFC9430], in order to allow the alternative use of
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] when CoAP is transported
   over TCP or WebSockets [RFC8323].

   The DTLS profile [RFC9202] allows C and RS to establish a DTLS
   session with peer authentication based on symmetric or asymmetric
   cryptography.  For the latter case, the profile defines an RPK mode
   (see Section 3.2 of [RFC9202]), where authentication relies on the
   public keys of the two peers as raw public keys [RFC7250].

   That is, C specifies its public key to the AS when requesting an
   access token, and the AS provides such public key to the target RS as
   included in the issued access token.  Upon issuing the access token,
   the AS also provides C with the public key of RS.  Then, C and RS use
   their asymmetric keys when performing the DTLS handshake, as defined
   in [RFC7250].

   Per [RFC9202], the DTLS profile admits only a COSE Key object
   [RFC9052] as the format of authentication credentials to use for
   transporting the public keys of C and RS, as raw public keys.
   However, it is desirable to enable additional formats of
   authentication credentials, as enhanced raw public keys or as public
   certificates.

   This document enables such additional formats in the DTLS profile, by
   defining how the public keys of C and RS can be specified by means of
   CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Sets (CCSs) [RFC8392], or X.509
   certificates [RFC5280], or C509 certificates
   [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert].  In particular, this document
   updates [RFC9202] as follows.

   *  It extends the RPK mode defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9202], by
      enabling the use of CCSs to wrap the raw public keys of C and RS
      (see Section 2).

      [ TODO: Further extend the RPK mode, by admitting the
      identification of COSE Keys by reference, using the CWT
      Confirmation Method 'ckt' defined in
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-cose-key-
      thumbprint ]

   *  It defines a new certificate mode, which enables the use of X.509
      or C509 certificates to specify the public keys of C and RS (see
      Section 3).  In either case, certificates can be transported by
      value or instead identified by reference.

   When using the updated RPK mode, the raw public keys of C and RS do
   not have to be of the same format.  That is, it is possible to have
   both public keys as a COSE Key object or as a CCS, or instead one as
   a COSE Key object while the other one as a CCS.

   When using the certificate mode, the certificates of C and RS do not
   have to be of the same format.  That is, it is possible to have both
   as X.509 certificates, or both as C509 certificates, or one as an
   X.509 certificate while the other one as a C509 certificate.
   Furthermore, it is possible to have both certificates transported by
   value, or both identified by reference, or one transported by value
   while the other one identified by reference.

   Also, the RPK mode and the certificate mode can be combined.  That
   is, it is possible that one of the two authentication credentials is
   a certificate, while the other one is a raw public key.

   When using the formats introduced in this document, authentication
   credentials are specified by means of the CWT Confirmation Methods
   "kccs", "x5bag", "x5chain", "x5t", "x5u", "c5b", "c5c", "c5t", and
   "c5u" that are defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   What is defined in this document is seamlessly applicable if TLS is
   used instead, as defined in [RFC9430].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization
   [RFC9200][RFC9201] and its DTLS profile [RFC9202], as well as with
   terms and concepts related to CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392] and
   CWT Confirmation Methods [RFC8747].

   The terminology for entities in the considered architecture is
   defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  In particular, this includes client
   (C), resource server (RS), and authorization server (AS).

   Readers are also expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CoAP [RFC7252], CBOR [RFC8949], CDDL [RFC8610], COSE
   [RFC9052][RFC9053], the DTLS protocol suite [RFC6347][RFC9147], and
   the use of raw public keys in DTLS [RFC7250].

   Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth
   definition, aimed at denoting resources such as /token and
   /introspect at the AS, and /authz-info at RS.  This document does not
   use the CoAP definition of "endpoint", which is "An entity
   participating in the CoAP protocol."

   This document also refers to the term "authentication credential",
   which denotes the information associated with an entity, including
   that entity's public key and parameters associated with the public
   key.  Examples of authentication credentials are CWT Claims Sets
   (CCSs) [RFC8392], X.509 certificates [RFC5280], and C509 certificates
   [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert].

   Examples throughout this document are expressed in CBOR diagnostic
   notation as defined in Section 8 of [RFC8949] and Appendix G of
   [RFC8610].  Diagnostic notation comments are often used to provide a
   textual representation of the parameters' keys and values.

   In the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, constructs of
   the form e'SOME_NAME' are replaced by the value assigned to SOME_NAME
   in the CDDL model shown in Figure 13 of Appendix B.  For example,
   {e'x5chain' : h'3081...cb02'} stands for {5 : h'3081...cb02'}.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please delete the paragraph immediately preceding
   this note.  Also, in the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this
   document, please replace the constructs of the form e'SOME_NAME' with
   the value assigned to SOME_NAME in the CDDL model shown in Figure 13
   of Appendix B.  Finally, please delete this note.

2.  Updates to the RPK Mode

   This section updates the RPK mode defined in Section 3.2 of
   [RFC9202], by defining how the raw public key of C and RS can be
   provided as wrapped by a CCS [RFC8392], instead of as a COSE Key
   object [RFC9052].  Note that only the differences from [RFC9202] are
   compiled below.

   If the raw public key of C is wrapped by a CCS, then the following
   applies.

   *  The payload of the Access Token Request (see Section 5.8.1 of
      [RFC9200]) is as defined in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC9202], with the
      difference that the "req_cnf" parameter [RFC9201] MUST specify a
      "kccs" structure, with value a CCS specifying the public key of C
      that has to be bound to the access token.

      In particular, the CCS MUST include the "cnf" claim specifying the
      public key of C as a COSE Key object, SHOULD include the "sub"
      claim specifying the subject name of C associated with the public
      key of C, and MAY include additional claims.

   *  The content of the access token that the AS provides to C in the
      Access Token Response (see Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]) is as
      defined in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC9202], with the difference that
      the "cnf" claim of the access token MUST specify a "kccs"
      structure, with value a CCS specifying the public key of C that is
      bound to the access token.

      In particular, the CCS MUST include the "cnf" claim specifying the
      public key of C as a COSE Key object, SHOULD include the "sub"
      claim specifying the subject name of C associated with the public
      key of C, and MAY include additional claims.

   If the raw public key of RS is wrapped by a CCS, then the following
   applies.

   *  The payload of the Access Token Response is as defined in
      Section 3.2.1 of [RFC9202], with the difference that the "rs_cnf"
      parameter [RFC9201] MUST specify a "kccs" structure, with value a
      CCS specifying the public key of RS.

      In particular, the CCS MUST include the "cnf" claim specifying the
      public key of RS as a COSE Key object, SHOULD include the "sub"
      claim specifying the subject name of RS associated with the public
      key of RS, and MAY include additional claims.

   For the "req_cnf" parameter of the Access Token Request, the "rs_cnf"
   parameter of the Access Token Response, and the "cnf" claim of the
   access token, the Confirmation Method "kccs" structure and its
   identifier are defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   It is not required that both public keys are wrapped by a CCS.  That
   is, one of the two authentication credentials can be a CCS, while the
   other one can be a COSE Key object as per Section 3.2 of [RFC9202].

3.  Certificate Mode

   This section defines a new certificate mode of the DTLS profile,
   which enables the use of public certificates to specify the public
   keys of C and RS.  Compared to the RPK mode defined in Section 3.2 of
   [RFC9202] and extended in Section 2 of this document, the certificate
   mode displays the differences compiled below.

   The authentication credential of C and/or RS is a public certificate,
   i.e., an X.509 certificate [RFC5280] or a C509 certificate
   [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert].

   *  The CWT Confirmation Methods "x5chain", "x5bag", "c5c", and "c5b"
      defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] are used to
      transport such authentication credentials by value.

   *  The CWT Confirmation Methods "x5t", "x5u", "c5t", and "c5u"
      defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] are used to
      identify such authentication credentials by reference.

   If the authentication credential AUTH_CRED_C of C is a public
   certificate, then the following applies.

   *  The "req_cnf" parameter [RFC9201] of the Access Token Request (see
      Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]) specifies AUTH_CRED_C as follows.

      If AUTH_CRED_C is an X.509 certificate, the "req_cnf" parameter
      MUST specify:

      -  An "x5chain" or "x5bag" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is
         transported by value within a certificate chain or a
         certificate bag, respectively; or

      -  An "x5t" or "x5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

      If AUTH_CRED_C is a C509 certificate, the "req_cnf" parameter MUST
      specify:

      -  A "c5c" or "c5b" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is transported
         by value within a certificate chain or a certificate bag,
         respectively; or

      -  A "c5t" or "c5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

   *  The "cnf" claim of the access token that the AS provides to C in
      the Access Token Response (see Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200])
      specifies AUTH_CRED_C as follows.

      If AUTH_CRED_C is an X.509 certificate, the "cnf" claim MUST
      specify:

      -  An "x5chain" or "x5bag" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is
         transported by value within a certificate chain or a
         certificate bag, respectively; or

      -  An "x5t" or "x5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

      If AUTH_CRED_C is a C509 certificate, the "cnf" claim MUST
      specify:

      -  A "c5c" or "c5b" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is transported
         by value within a certificate chain or a certificate bag,
         respectively; or

      -  A "c5t" or "c5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_C is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

   If the authentication credential AUTH_CRED_RS of RS is a public
   certificate, then the following applies.

   *  The "rs_cnf" parameter [RFC9201] of the Access Token Response
      specifies AUTH_CRED_RS as follows.

      If AUTH_CRED_RS is an X.509 certificate, the "rs_cnf" parameter
      MUST specify:

      -  An "x5chain" or "x5bag" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_RS is
         transported by value within a certificate chain or a
         certificate bag, respectively; or

      -  An "x5t" or "x5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_RS is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

      If AUTH_CRED_RS is a C509 certificate, the "rs_cnf" parameter MUST
      specify:

      -  A "c5c" or "c5b" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_RS is transported
         by value within a certificate chain or a certificate bag,
         respectively; or

      -  A "c5t" or "c5u" structure, in case AUTH_CRED_RS is identified
         by reference through a hash value (a thumbprint) or a URI
         [RFC3986], respectively.

   For the "req_cnf" parameter of the Access Token Request, the "rs_cnf"
   parameter of the Access Token Response, and the "cnf" claim of the
   access token, the structures "x5bag", "x5chain", "x5t", "x5u", "c5b",
   "c5c", "c5t", and "c5u" are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], together with their identifiers.

   When using either of the structures, the specified authentication
   credential is just the end-entity certificate.

   As per [RFC6347] and [RFC9147], a public certificate is specified in
   the Certificate message of the DTLS handshake.  For X.509
   certificates, the TLS Certificate Type is "X509", as defined in
   [RFC6091].  For C509 certificates, the TLS certificate type is "C509
   Certificate", as defined in [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert].

   It is not required that AUTH_CRED_C and AUTH_CRED_RS are both X.509
   certificates or both C509 certificates.  Also, it is not required
   that AUTH_CRED_C and AUTH_CRED_RS are both transported by value or
   both identified by reference.

   Finally, one of the two authentication credentials can be a public
   certificate, while the other one can be a raw public key.  This is
   consistent with the admitted, combined use of raw public keys and
   certificates, as discussed in Section 5.3 of [RFC7250].

3.1.  Examples

   Figure 3 shows an example of Access Token Request from C to the AS.
   In the example, C specifies its authentication credential by means of
   an "x5chain" structure, transporting by value only its own X.509
   certificate.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC9200] and [RFC9202] apply to
   this document as well.

   When using public certificates as authentication credentials, the
   security considerations from Appendix C.2 of [RFC8446] apply.

   When using X.509 certificates as authentication credentials, the
   security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC6818], [RFC9598],
   [RFC9549], [RFC9608], and [RFC9618] apply.

   When using C509 certificates as authentication credentials, the
   security considerations from [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert] apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Examples with Hybrid Settings

   This section provides additional examples where, within the same ACE
   execution workflow, C and RS use different formats of raw public keys
   (see Appendix A.1), or different formats of certificates (see
   Appendix A.2), or a combination of the RPK mode and certificate mode
   (see Appendix A.3).

A.1.  RPK Mode (Raw Public Keys of Different Formats)

   Figure 7 shows an example of Access Token Request from C to the AS,
   where the public key of C is conveyed as a COSE Key.
